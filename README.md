# About

My attempt at a theme. Nowhere close to what I want, but it's a start. 

Built with [VSCode Theme Studio](https://themes.vscode.one/theme/mdashallanson/gIQNhWZJ); 

Colours are mostly adapted from Tailwind's full palette.

Maybe I could experiment with different font / weight styles? e.g. see https://input.djr.com/info/

## Background

In case you're curious, here's how my "dream theme" would work:  

- High contrast between text and background
- Low contrast between different pieces of text
- Light and dark variants
- Not ugly :)

Dracula PRO nails the first item and last items on that list. But I've never been able to find something that fulfills every item on that list. Some themes that come close are:

- Nord theme (https://www.nordtheme.com/ports/visual-studio-code). I love the colours in this, and the low contrast between different parts of text. But the comments are almost illegible to me. I tried adjusting the background and comment colours. But I couldn't find something that looked good _and_ had enough contrast.

- Solarized (https://ethanschoonover.com/solarized/). I used this for several years. These days I want less colours in the text, and higher contrast between the text and background. I like the light and dark versions, and the colours look great together. Also Solarized has the best reason for choosing a specific colour:

> "The blue is beautiful and terrifying to me when I use it at about 96% opacity. I have a very strong, long term fear of death by drowning and this correlates to what I imagine is the green blue of deep ocean water, filled with the sediment stirred up by the ocean liner as it impacts on the seabed. I realize there would be no visible light there, but that hardly matters ." (https://www.metafilter.com/102504/Solarized#3636286)

- VSCode's built in "Dark" and "Light" themes (https://vscodethemes.com/e/ms-vscode.cpptools-themes). Currently I'm using the default "Dark" and "Light" (_not_ the "Dark+" and "Light+" variants). They do well enough on the above points but they're just not very inspiring to stare at all day.

- Verdandi and Verdandi Alter (https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=be5invis.theme-verdandi). These are lovely but a tiny bit too minimal. It's like it just needs a few more colours. The screenshots don't really do it justice, I'd recommend trying it out.

- Night Owl and Night Owl Light (https://github.com/sdras/night-owl-vscode-theme). I love the light theme, but I want a bit more contrast between foreground and background. The dark theme is also great, but I want _less_ contrast between the different syntax colours.

## Install

Copy files to ~/.vscode/extensions/lilo-theme
